# Pratik13

This project demonstrates the usage of a simple `Kitap` (Book) class in C#. The `Kitap` class includes properties such as `Ad` (Name), `YazarAdi` (Author's First Name), `YazarSoyadi` (Author's Last Name), `SayfaSayisi` (Number of Pages), `Yayinevi` (Publisher), and `KayitTarihi` (Registration Date).

### Project Structure

- `Kitap.cs`: Contains the definition of the `Kitap` class.
- `Program.cs`: Demonstrates how to create instances of the `Kitap` class and set its properties.

### Acknowledgments

- This project is created for educational purposes to demonstrate basic class usage in C#.
